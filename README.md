### FAQ 

##### Question: What is Docker? 
**Answer:** Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

##### Question: Why do you used docker?
**Answer:** Using Docker can help you ship your code faster, gives you control over your applications. You can deploy applications on containers that make it easier for them to be deployed, scaled, perform rollbacks and identify issues. I am learning about DevOps so whatsoever I am learning I applying those technologies to my project also.
